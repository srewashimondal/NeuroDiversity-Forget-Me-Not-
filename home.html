            <p>In the workforce, autistic people may not show clear signs of disability, but they may still struggle with social skills like reading body language or being comfortable in a group. This can lead to missed opportunities at work and misunderstandings with bosses and coworkers. Autistic people often become very stressed when confronted with change. In the workplace, there's potential for change to happen overnight, often in a way that is out of the autistic person's control. The anxiety of trying to cope with change can lead some people to leave their job altogether.</p>
          <ul></ul>
            <p><em>Did you know that an autistic professional is up to <b>140%</b> more productive than an average employee when properly matched to a job that fits their skills? </em>Yet, discrimination against neurodivergent people continues. This is the problem Forget-Me-Not is working towards solving. We are providing this task workplace management platform accessible to provide autistic people the resources they need to successfully manage, complete, and uphold tasks required in the job force.</p>
