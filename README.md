# NeuroDiversity-Forget-Me-Not-
NeuroDiversity: Forget-Me-Not bridges workforce gaps with task management website for seamless communication, empowering neurodivergent individuals with detailed instructions and flexible management. We created this website for Columbia University's DivHacks 2023 hackathon and won Best Beginner Hack Award and Diversity Award.

Inspiration:
We are deeply inspired by the idea of NeuroDiversity: Forget-Me-Not because it addresses a pressing issue in the workforce that has been largely overlooked. It's disheartening to see the number of autistic individuals in the workforce decreasing when their unique skills, like quick thinking and intelligence, are in high demand. This project is important because it aims to create inclusiveness for neurodivergent individuals, ensuring they have equal opportunities to thrive in the workplace. What sets Forget-Me-Not apart is its dedication to catering specifically to the needs of autistic people, providing them with the tools and support they require for success.

What it does:
Forget_Me_Not Platform: Enhances team communication and task management.​
Task Management: Replace in-person feedback with written tasks in Forget_Me_Not.​
Respect for Autistic Users: Avoid contacting employees when they're marked as (Offline).​
Customization: Users can customize the platform; beneficial for individuals who thrive with structured routines and visual schedules.

How we built it:
We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript using VisualStudioCode and Repl.it. We used Canva for our logo.

Challenges we ran into:
This is everyone's first hackathon in our team. We struggled to find teammates, ideas, and implement in the short time limit. We have not used OpenAI source in code before. We worked very hard on implementing a Chat box feature in our website but unfortunately due to time limit, we were unable to. But it is something we are passionate towards and will work on after this hackathon as well.

Accomplishments that we're proud of:
By bridging the communication gap between managers and neurodivergent employees through detailed instructions and flexible management, this platform not only empowers individuals but also benefits businesses by tapping into a valuable talent pool. In a world that increasingly values diversity and inclusion, NeuroDiversity: Forget-Me-Not is a vital initiative that can drive positive change in both the lives of neurodivergent individuals and the organizations fortunate enough to have them as part of their teams.

What we learned:
We need to keep going. This is a serious conflict and we didn't know about this obstacle autistic people faced.

What's next for NeuroDiversity: Forget-Me-Not​:
We hope to incorporate AI to provide more accessibility on our platform for neurodivergent people.
